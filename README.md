# A big tooth cohort

We scanned a *big* bunch of teeth for a team of [the dental clinic of the University of Bern](https://www.zmk.unibe.ch/).

To get an overview of the samples *while* we scanned the whole tooth cohort we generated a [preview and analysis notebook](ToothAnalysis.ipynb).
The analysis notebook (with download possibility for two of the +100 teeth) can be started in your browser by clicking on the 'Binder' badge above, without installation of any software.
If you'd like to start a Binder instance with the full repository, you can click [here](https://mybinder.org/v2/gh/habi/zmk-tooth-cohort/master
).

We want to programmatically generate three-dimensional visualizations of the teeth with the [`itkwidgets`](https://github.com/InsightSoftwareConsortium/itkwidgets).
For this we use the [display notebook](ToothDisplay.ipynb).

To be able to brag a bit about how much date we produced scanned and to add these numbers to the '[materials & methods](https://habi.github.io/zmk-tooth-cohort-method-manuscript/#materials-methods)' and '[discussion](https://habi.github.io/zmk-tooth-cohort-method-manuscript/#results-and-discussion)' sections of the [manuscript](https://habi.github.io/zmk-tooth-cohort-method-manuscript/) we whipped up a [data size bragging notebook](ToothDataSize.ipynb).
